cpslc -- the Compilers Project Source Language Compiler
By William Hatch

An exciting class project for CS5300 at Utah State University.

The executable "cpslc" is the compiler.
It prints a lovely help message if run with -h, --help, or an unknown argument.
Syntax is:
cpslc [-hv] [-f infile] [-o outfile]
where the flags can be replaced by --help, --verbose, --file, and --output respectively.
It currently has shift/reduce errors on two rules, but I want them to shift, so it's good.


The executable "lextest" is just a lexical analyzer.  It prints int values for the symbols found, and their yylval
value if they're an identifier or constant (int, string, or char).  It takes the name of a file or
it reads from stdin.


Umm... to build, run make.  Have fun.
