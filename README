cpslc -- the Compilers Project Source Language Compiler
By William Hatch

An exciting class project for CS5300 at Utah State University.

So right now it's a lexical analyzer... it prints int values for the symbols found, and their yylval
value if they're an identifier or constant (int, string, or char).  It takes the name of a file or
it reads from stdin.

The symbol values are all in symbols.h.

Umm... to build, run make.  Have fun.
