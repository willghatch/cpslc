cpslc -- the Compilers Project Source Language Compiler
By William Hatch

An exciting class project for CS5300 at Utah State University.

The executable "cpslc" is the compiler... which currently just tells whether or not it parses successfully.
It reads from the file specified in the first command line parameter, or stdin.
It currently has shift/reduce errors on two rules, but I want them to shift.  Later
maybe I'll iron those out.

It has a verbose option that can be enabled by adding --verbose


The executable "lextest" is just a lexical analyzer.  It prints int values for the symbols found, and their yylval
value if they're an identifier or constant (int, string, or char).  It takes the name of a file or
it reads from stdin.


Umm... to build, run make.  Have fun.
